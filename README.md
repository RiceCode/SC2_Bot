# SC2_Bot

A for fun project to write Bots for StarCraft2. This project uses Burny's SC2 library https://github.com/BurnySc2/python-sc2 

There were several update patches to SC2 since the bot was last updated in 2019. Bot may not be run with current SC2 patch. 

Riceling.py - A scripted bot using the Zerg race. This bot starts off peacefully, expanding quickly while scounting for enemy. Once resources starts to pile up OR if enemy army is spotted, it'll start building an army. 

Ricetoss.py - A first attempt to build a machine learning bot. There was some issues with the bot interacting with the client, and the project was put on hold. This project has never been completed.
